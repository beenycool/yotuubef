- **Better engagement tactics** including FOMO and curiosity gaps

### 2. Immediate Hook Text Implementation
- **3-second rule compliance**: Hook text appears immediately (0-3 seconds)
- **Dynamic hook text sizing**: 8% of video height for maximum impact
- **Dramatic styling**: Yellow text with black stroke, uppercase formatting
- **Zoom-in animation**: Creates immediate visual interest

### 3. Advanced Audio Processing
- **Enhanced sound effect mapping** with fallback alternatives
- **Improved background music selection** based on AI mood analysis
- **Better audio ducking** during narrative segments
- **Sound effect categorization** (impact, transition, liquid, mechanical, etc.)
- **Contextual volume adjustments** based on emotion

### 4. Visual Storytelling Enhancements
- **Enhanced color grading** with saturation boost and contrast enhancement
- **Dynamic pan/zoom** based on AI-identified focus points
- **Speed ramping** for dramatic effect (slow-motion for impacts, speed-up for action)
- **Shadow/highlight enhancement** for better dynamic range

### 5. Improved Call-to-Action System
- **Mood-specific like reminders** ("Like if this is INSANE!" for intense content)
- **Contextual end screens** ("Subscribe for more epic race moments!" for sports)
- **Better timing**: Like reminder at 10 seconds, end screen in last 4 seconds
- **Enhanced animations** with pulsing and slide-in effects

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### AI Prompt Enhancements
```python
# Enhanced mood-based music selection
mood_to_category = {
    'intense': 'suspenseful',
    'dramatic': 'suspenseful', 
    'uplifting': 'upbeat',
    'amazing': 'upbeat',
    'satisfying': 'relaxing',
    # ... more mappings
}
```

### Sound Effect Processing
- **Smart file discovery** with multiple format support (.wav, .mp3, .ogg)
- **Partial matching** for missing sound files
- **Volume normalization** and fade in/out for smooth integration
- **Timestamp validation** to prevent effects beyond video duration

### Visual Enhancement Pipeline
1. **Hook text** (immediate - 0s)
2. **Color grading** (enhanced saturation + contrast)
3. **Dynamic pan/zoom** or subtle zoom fallback
4. **Speed effects** (strategic slow-motion/speed-up)
5. **Visual cues** and overlays
6. **CTA elements** (like reminder at 10s, end screen at -4s)

### Audio Processing Order
1. **Original audio** (15% volume, preserve natural sounds)
2. **Background music** (mood-based selection with ducking)
3. **TTS narration** (emotional volume adjustments)
4. **Sound effects** (contextual placement with fades)
5. **Auditory CTAs** (like/subscribe reminders)

## ðŸ“Š Configuration Updates

### New Audio Settings
```yaml
